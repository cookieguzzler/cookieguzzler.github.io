I’m Nijat Khalilov, a 3rd-year Computer Science student at Manchester Metropolitan University, passionate about the world of AI, computer vision, and data science. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve been refining my skills in programming languages like C++ and Python, while also exploring game development engines such as Unity3D, Unreal Engine, and Godot. These tools fuel my interest in immersive environments and virtual reality applications.

My enthusiasm for AI, data science, and computer vision drives me to continuously learn and explore new frontiers in technology. Whether it’s researching the latest AI techniques, developing web projects, or working on immersive applications, I’m always seeking ways to push boundaries and apply my knowledge to real-world challenges.
