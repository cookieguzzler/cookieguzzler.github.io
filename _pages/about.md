I‚Äôm Nijat Khalilov, a 3rd-year Computer Science student at Manchester Metropolitan University, passionate about the world of AI, computer vision, and data science. Throughout my academic journey, I‚Äôve been refining my skills in programming languages like C++ and Python, while also exploring game development engines such as Unity3D, Unreal Engine, and Godot. These tools fuel my interest in immersive environments and virtual reality applications.

My enthusiasm for AI, data science, and computer vision drives me to continuously learn and explore new frontiers in technology. Whether it‚Äôs researching the latest AI techniques, developing web projects, or working on immersive applications, I‚Äôm always seeking ways to push boundaries and apply my knowledge to real-world challenges.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
